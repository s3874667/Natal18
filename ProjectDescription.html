        <h2 id="pageHeading"> Project Description </h2>

        <h3 id="subHeading"> Aims </h3>
        <p>
          The main aim of this project is to reduce food wastage and reduce the environmental impact of food production.  In it’s initial release, the Natal fridge will be focused on features that will have the most impact on reducing food wastage. Additional, less vital features will be updated in future software updates and versions of the fridge. The major release features are those that set the Natal fridge apart from competitors: Profile and Diet Customisation, Smart Food Ordering, and Replenishing Staples and Food Spoilage Alerts. <br><br>

          The two priority features of that the Natal Fridge’s first release are Profile and Diet customisation, and Smart ordering. Given the main motivation for this product is to reduce environmental impact and reduce food wastage, these features are highly important to the Natal fridge achieving this goal. Ordering food in the correct portions needed for each household member will reduce the amount of food entering a household that could be unnecessarily wasted due to spoilage.
          <br><br>

          Food spoilage alerts and notifications are a last resort, as smart ordering and meal plan generation should already largely mitigate the likelihood of food expiring or going to waste in the Natal Fridge. Furthermore, Food spoilage alerts are likely to be one of the more difficult aims to achieve, as it involves Tummy actively monitoring the contents of the fridge. This feature would more likely be introduced as a future software update, providing the Natal fridge was built with the require hardware.
        </p>

        <h3 id="subHeading"> Roles </h3>
        <p>
          Up to this point, we did not have a need to define specific roles within our team. This is mostly due to the low skills set of each team member and our project has been more of a learning exercise. Specific team members have had more influence over different aspects of the project. Officially defined roles at this stage seems unnecessary and each member was instead allocated a different section of the project to work on and most team members contributed to a range of different parts.
          <h3> Team Members Roles </h3>
          Muzzammil- Website design lead. <br><br>
          Muzzammil has had the most influence on the design and layout of the website and bought the website to the stage it is to this point.
          <br><br>
          Yi Dai- Website Developer<br><br>
          Yi did some work on setting up the git hub repository and participated in the development.
          <br><br>
          Nushura- User interface design<br><br>
          Nushura designed the visual aspects of the project to this point.
          <br><br>
          Renelo – Lead researcher<br><br>
          Renelo did a large amount of research regarding the skill sets and technologies the project will need moving forward.
          <br><br>
          Anthony – Project Developer<br><br>
          Anthony complied the report and had a lot of influence on the direction and development of the project.
          <br><br>
          Jack – Project planner<br><br>
          Jack made the Initial timeframe for the project
          <br><br>

          If this project was taken to the next stage of development, official key roles for each team member would need to be defined. Ideally these specific roles wouldn’t change as we all have such a low skill set at this stage. We would need to spend a lot of time developing our skill sets for the role we were assigned. After each future stage of the project was implemented, there would be opportunity to change roles.

          <h3> Key Roles </h3>
          When the project is taken out of the early development stage, we have four key roles defined that could carry out the work.
          <br><br>

          Database Engineer
          <br><br>

          Tummy will need to access to a large database of information, including nutritional information, recipes and statistical information on food life cycles. A Database Engineer is essential to setting up a fast and reliable database that Tummy can access. This information can be readily obtained from existing sources and would just need to be collated.
          <br><br>
          Lead Software engineer
          <br><br>
          A software engineer would be required to design the different aspects of original software required for the project. They would need to be fluent in multiple program languages and able to oversee other programmers. They would need to interreact with the User interface designer
          <br><br>
          User Interface Designer
          <br><br>
          The natal fridge is going to be a product that relies on user interaction. It's imperative that there is a clean a crisp user interface. Even if every other feature of the Natal fridge is operational at launch. If it has a poor user interface and the user might become angry or frustrated with the product and it could result in people not using it.
          <br><br>
          Ai and Machine learning specialist
          <br><br>
          As Tummy will have learn user habits as well as construct diet plans, suggest recipes and construct shopping lists a specialist familiar with AI technologies and who is familiar with their implementation. Will be essential to the success of the project.
          <br><br>
          Note.
          <br><br>
          These key roles are very general, for the natal fridge to be taken the next level a wide range of professionals would need to be consulted and have input for the project.
          For further description of the roles refer to Skills and Jobs Section.
        </p>

        <h3 id="subHeading"> Scopes & Limits </h3>
        <p>
          The scope of this project was defined in early discussions about which features were the most important to achieve set goals. The project initially focused on Tummy monitoring freshness of food with an internal camera and notifying users when food was close to expiring. This was determined to be unrealistic and time consuming to implement and did not address the root cause of household food wastage. It was far more important to prioritize the Household Profiles and Diet Customization, as well as smart ordering. These features will better address food wastage problems and achieve our project goals.
          <br><br>
          At release, we would prioritize these two features as a minimum for the Natal fridge, but ideally also be able include the food spoilage alerts and notifications. As this project is IT focused, it was also decided that we would aim to implement Tummy and the three major features in conjunction with an existing smart fridge. We are not focusing on the designing a fridge, instead integrating them into an existing product. If we were to consider all the factors that would be involved in developing a fridge from scratch the scope of this project would be out of reach of the team.
        </p>

        <h3 id="subHeading"> Tools, Technologies and Skills </h3>
        <p>
          For this AI smart fridge project to successfully be accomplished, the use of a wide range of tools and technologies will be necessary. These various tools and technologies range from software to hardware – from operating systems to Raspberry Pi.
          <h3> Operating System</h3>
           As mentioned previously, The Natal Fridge will have an interactive, touchscreen, user display positioned on one of the fridge’s doors. It will represent a tablet almost. This hardware component of the AI smart fridge is where all the user interactivity will occur. Pretty much everything nowadays runs from an OS (Operating System) – our phones, computers, tablets, smart watches, and even in car HUDs! (Heads-Up-Display); so, it would only make sense if our AI smart fridge would run off from an operating system. <br><br>

           There are many different operating systems out there on the market, but for our project we will be planning on running our smart fridge off of the Android operating system. The reason as to why Android is the chosen operating system, is because Android is easy to obtain a license for (from Google), and it isn’t that hard to implement and code using language such as Python and such.
           <br><br>

           The Android OS usually comes with its own personal assistant, ‘Google Assistant’ but however, at Natal, we’re planning on creating our own personal assistant, ‘Tummy’, which’ll be different to Google Assistant, as it’ll be more focused on the likes of food – expiration, recipes, and grocery lists, etc..
           <br><br>

           <h3> Rasberry Pi </h3>
           A tool which has great importance in building a smart fridge is Raspberry Pi. It is used widely in terms of home automation. The cost of this mini device is less as well, making the use of it to be cost effective (Reisinger, D 2020). However, using this tiny device is not as easy and if anyone wants to use it, they need to be willing to work hard and get it done right. In terms of using a particular version of using Raspberry Pi, it would be the best if Raspberry Pi 3 is used since it is the most powerful Pi (Reisinger, D 2020). Firstly, to use this device it needs to be connected to the internet to get the work started. Raspberry Pi is the device which will help users to connect with Tummy from wherever they are, so, internet connection is vital. Furthermore, there will be a microSD card inserted inside Raspberry Pi as well, where all the data will be stored (Reisinger, D 2020).

           <h3> AI and our Personal Assistant, Tummy </h3>
           In order to develop our AI, the following tools are required:
           <ul>
             <li> Acquiring high processing powered computers with abundant RAM and NVME SSD storage speeds
             <li> Acquiring a sizeable workspace to carry out our project efficiently
             <li> Ensuring there is enough electricity to provide for our workspace – Tummy will be build to be energy efficient as well.
             <li> Establishing a secure cloud server to manage our data efficiently – as users personal account and details will be there inside the device.
             <li> Acquiring hardware components for manufacturing the base fridge – However, reinvention of the wheel will not take place.
           </ul>

           The following technical skills are required:
           <ul>
             <li>	Experience in programming languages such as Java, C++, Python, LISP, Prolog
             <li> Experience in mark-up languages such as HTML and CSS

             <li> Experience in marketing and product advertising
             <li>Experience in engineering and certification in hardware development
           </ul>

           The following general skills are required:
           <ul>
             <li> Creativity and Innovative thinking - a product always need update, both in terms of functionalities and design, so that it can stay in the market and gain higher demand from the consumers. Hence, us, as developers need to be have creative thinking skills.
             <li> Leadership qualities - In every team, most members should have leadership qualities. This will increase the team’s potential to grow in a market and promote their products.
             <li> Must be able to work cooperatively in a team-based workspace
             <li> Possesses analytical reasoning and experience in problem solving – At any project, there will be thousands of obstacles, so debugging them one by one and not giving up is a key to do good in the market.
             <li> Tardiness and ability to stay on top of their given work – Coming up with unique ideas and staying in demand with what the consumers want must be always at the back of a producer’s mind.
             <li> Resilience - To be able to work efficiently during stressful periods.
             <li> Empathy - Must be empathetic and accepting of other employees’ feelings.
        </p>

        <h3 id="subHeading"> Testing </h3>
        <p>
          We are currently is in the formative stage of the project, therefore a limited amount of testing has been completed. Rough user groups have been identified through brainstorming and team discussion. Moving forward into a Prototyping / Proof of concept stage, more testing be required to define user groups more specifically. All current evidence used to determine user groups has been anecdotal.
          <br><br>
          As this Natal Fridge relies on a lot of user interaction, more significant user testing should be completed before moving forward. If time allowed and this project was taken to market, we would undergo three stages of testing and refinement.
          <br><br>
          <h3> Formative Testing- Stage One </h3>
          The information collected at stage one would be used to lay groundwork for the project and gain insight and direction into what features to priorities. This would also give us insight into the project scope we should aim for and any limitations that we may encounter.
          <br><br>
          Competitor Analysis - Complete<br><br>
          Market research had been conducted to determine the landscape of the smart fridge market, ensuring similar products with our proposed features do not already exist.
          <br><br>

         Identifying User Groups – Partially Complete<br><br>
         User groups have been identified from team discussions and have been elaborated on by creating personas for each. This could have been expanded on by conducting surveys and individual interviews with potential users, to better our understanding of how they would utilize the features of the Natal Fridge.
         <br><br>

         <h3> Prototyping / Proof on Concept - Stage Two </h3>
         The information that would be collected at this stage is somewhat speculative but would be crucial to refining the Natal Fridge. It would confirm the information deduced from earlier user testing. The insights gained here would lead the direction of the project into completion.
         <br><br>
         Paper Prototyping and User Feedback – Partially complete <br><br>
         Paper Prototyping and wire frames have been completed to align with the context scenarios written for each persona. More user feedback could be collected at this stage by presenting wire frames to potential users, identifying early issues people may have the User Interface or the features.
         <br><br>
         Soft protype- Planned <br><br>
         After user feedback has been collected, a soft protype of Tummy and priority features should be completed. After a working protype was ready, it could be implemented in users' homes to see how they interact with Tummy and what features they will likely utilize. Using a combination of logging user interactions and methods such as diary studies or user interviews, we can use the information gathered to refine the soft protype into the product.

         <h3> Summative User Experience and Refinement – Stage Three </h3>

         Once the Natal fridge was released, user interaction and follow up surveys could be conducted on a wider scale. This would help the team introduce new features and refine issues that had been overlooked after initial release.
         <br><br>
         User Logging- Planned <br><br>

         After launch, user interaction could be logged with consent, and more data could be collected en masse.
         <br><br>

         Experience survey’s – Planned<br><br>
         Once users have had the Natal fridge in their home for a certain period, Tummy will politely ask them to complete a survey about their experiences with the product. These could be done at multiple time points: After the user has had the fridge for two weeks, three months, 6 months and 12 months. This would allow us to gain more insight into what user like and dislike about the product.
        </p>

        <h3 id="subHeading"> Timeframe </h3>
        <p>



        </p>

        <h3 id="subHeading"> Risks </h3>
        <p>
          <h3>Limited Experience and knowledge</h3>
          Each stage of this project presents different risks.  The biggest initial risk is the limited skills of our team.  Each member would need to spend considerable time and effort gaining relevant skills and knowledge to bringing the Natal fridge to fruition. Taking this project further than the planning and concept stage would require outside assistance to achieve the goals set out.
          <br><br>
          Our teams lack of expertise in required fields may have also allowed for oversights during these early stages despite plenty of research, discussion and planning. Issues that may be more apparent to those more experienced in the field could have been overlooked by us and cause our project to become unattainable.

          <h3> Failing to Gain support in development stage </h3>
          If we progressed to a further development stage, the biggest issue would become that we have only allowed or planned for the Natal fridge technology to be implemented with an established company with smart fridges already in production. If the Natal fridge was unable to gain support from such a company, our scope would need to expand designing a fridge from scratch.  The amount of resources, professionals and different skills needed to complete this project would quickly become unrealistic.

          <h3> User hesitation to adopt new technology</h3>
          Anytime new technology is introduced to the market, there is almost always a level of hesitation to adopt it from certain parts of the population. Some potential users may dislike the idea of introducing AI assistance into their home. This risk is speculative and may not be an issue, but if the project went forward and more user testing was performed, this would be something that needs to be investigated.

          <h3> Product end cost </h3>
          This could possibly be one of the major prohibiting factors when the Natal fridge would be initially released. The Samsung Family Hub retails between $3000 to $5000 aud. The cost of implementing the features that we are proposing could increase the cost of these products further. Most household are unwilling to spend thousands on a fridge. Hopefully over time when these products have been on the market for some years the cost would reduce. There is some potential for these features to be developed as a stand-alone piece of software or application. If cost proves prohibitive this project could be explored as a standalone application.
        </p>

        <h3 id="subHeading"> Group Processes & Communication </h3>
        <p>
          When working in a team, does not matter how large the team is, but the communication between all the members is a vital part. The expected frequency of communication between the group members of Natal 18 is two to three times a week. We use Microsoft teams for the communication purpose of the project. Furthermore, now due to the Covid situation all the meetings and interactions are bound to happen online but when the situation gets better it can occur face to face which would be much more convenient.  We all have to be prepared that we can come across certain situation as well where some members are not responding, and we cannot expect that everything will go in a perfect manner all the time. So, in those times we will stay calm because there might be some serious issues happening with those people. However, if they are not responding at a regular basis then some actions should be taken, such as having a talk with them and getting to know what’s happening with them or letting them know that it is causing problems. Hence, we are and will also continue to allocate tasks, stay up to date with the progress of each members and make sure that everyone is following a progress plan.
        </p>
