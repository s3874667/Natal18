                 <p>About me:  <br><br>

                  I was born in Perth, Western Australia and relocated to Melbourne in 2010 where I completed my schooling. I graduated from VCE in 2019. I enrolled at Latrobe university at the start of 2020 where I completed my first semester of University but recently transferred to RMIT to continue my studies. My hobbies include exercising, learning programming languages and Gaming, I recently built my first gaming pc that has been occupying to much of time recently.  
                 <br><br> Interest in IT:  <br><br>
                  Since my youth, I have always been interested in the intricacy and details behind computers and how they operate. The mysteries behind how computers were able to interact and communicate with each other, the concept of Wireless internet and various software and programs that made our daily lives easier had fascinated me, which all contributed to my growing passion to one day be able to learn about and create my own programs that would benefit society. 
                   
                  Out of all the different universities that fell within my current qualifications, RMIT stood out as it best represented a place where I can establish an identity, develop my abilities and achieve the skills and knowledge required to enter the IT industry. 
                  As I progress through my course, I hope to learn the details behind the operation of computers, the various programming languages used in the development of the programs and software that make our lives easier, the ability to create and manage my own websites and servers, understand the importance of collaborations and teamwork during projects. Ultimately, being able to graduate with the skills and qualifications needed to enter the workforce. 
                 <br><br> Test Results: <br><br>
                  The above tests describe me to be an extraverted individual, who makes emotion driven decisions over logical thinking, and takes a prospective approach to their work. They also describe me to be a supportive and reliable individual, however with the risk to lose sight of the objective at hand. 
                  The results were close to home as they were to an extent an accurate representation of my character, which allowed me to better understand my strengths and weaknesses 
                  However the learning styles test conducted determined me to be an Auditory/tactile learner, These results don’t seem in line with my learning habits, as while I consider myself  to be a tactile learner, I tend to learn better visually through text and images over listening to information. 
                 <br> <br> Career plan: <br> <br>
                  In the future, I plan to pursue a career in game development. As displayed in the last assignment after analyzing the burning glass data, I have further reinforced in my decision due to the growing popularity and demands in the IT industry. Similar to other IT jobs in the industry, it requires a general knowledge and understanding of technologies and certain specialized programming languages, such as C++ and Java both of which are prevalent within other IT positions such as Software development. However, it branches of from data heavy positions such as Data Engineer and Cyber security Analysts due to its greater emphasis on object-oriented programming languages and design elements.

                 <p>About me:  <br><br>
                  I am from Dhaka, Bangladesh. I completed my education from an English medium school called Scholastica. During grade 12 I moved to Australia in 2019, for my foundation studies at RMIT University which I recently completed.  I can speak 3 languages, Bangla (native language). English and Hindi. My hobbies are playing badminton, art and dance, which I am passionate about. 
                 <br><br> Interest in IT  <br><br>
                  Jobs in IT are currently in high demand worldwide. Currently I am somewhat unfamiliar with all the different aspects of the IT industry. The more I am introduced to different concepts in the field, I am becoming more and more intrigued by it. When I was in high school, I often used to get worried when I was considering what field I should pursue my higher education in. Until I started to think about studying IT and I became more intrigued by the computing world.  After discussing my options with my family members, I concluded I should study IT. My siblings where the most influential people in my decision-making process as they helped me understand what was best for me.
                  There are many students who dreams of attending certain universities and in the same way I have dreamt of attending RMIT. RMIT is a reputational institution and is renowned for its excellence in education. RMIT also provides a lot of hands on experience that is directly applicable to real world scenarios and allows you network with many different people. Throughout my studies I want to gain knowledge which I can implement in my future career. Secondly, I expect to gain hands-on experience. Lastly, I want to build my people skills so that it can enhance my communication skill. This is possible by different group assignments. In addition to that, this is what many firms look for while hiring their employees. 
                 <br><br> Test Results: <br><br>
                  The results of these kind of tests can illustrate your behavior and its influence while working in a team. My results showed that I am friendly, careful, enthusiastic, organized, open-minded and curious. My friendly nature can spread a good vibe among other team members which might make working together a fun experience as they can be comfortable and can open up more. While working in a team we should be mindful that everyone will contribute different kind of ideas. So, being curious and an enthusiastic person, I can be open to gain new ideas and collaborate, but I am careful as well which might prevent any sort of clashes from occurring. However, the way we behave can depend heavily on the group members as well because if most of them are not contributing their efforts properly then it might cause pressure and disturbance within a group. Therefore, communicating properly and taking actions when something is going wrong is the key. 
                 <br><br> Career plan: <br><br>
                  My ideal job is software developer which requires some common skills and experience with the ideal jobs of my other team members. All require knowledge about some programming languages and all the positions needs workers to interact with their clients, to produce a product or service which is the most suitable for their use. The job sectors demand is still growing. However, each job sectors focus is different. A software developer will focus on developing software/apps, but a game developer/programmer’s focus will be making games, a data engineer will be working with data, software developer will focus on coding/ developing software. The qualifications required to be able to each job sectors differ too. For instance, software developer, cyber security analyst and Full stack developer requires bachelor’s degree, but a data engineer needs a Master/PhD degree.

            <h1 id="subHeading"> Jack Archer</h1>
                 <p>About Me  <br><br>
                  I studied at Taylor’s Lakes Secondary College and graduated with an ATAR of 73. I studied Math, Physics, English, two IT subjects. I have two pet dogs and recently became an uncle.  I’ve liked video games ever since played Halo:CE on the original Xbox. I’ve also been learning programming to code and create games in my spare time alongside learning about computer hardware and seeing how it evolves and continues to improve with each cycle. I play tennis competitively, before the pandemic I played in Juniors at A Reserve 5, which was near the top grade. I also played in Seniors at C Reserve 2 and I played Pennant at Grade 10. 
               <br><br>  Interest in IT  <br><br>
                 My interest in IT is primarily in programming and creating software and games, but I also have a bit of a side interest in computer hardware. My interest in IT started when I was 6 years old and my brother let me play the original Xbox with him and introduced me to Halo:CE, Halo 2 and both of the Star Wars Battlefront games. I was amazed and found them fun and as I got older, I wanted to know how they were made and even channel my creativity and time into something that could be played by myself, my family and my friends. In year 12 the course split into two different subjects, Informatics and Software Development. The teacher in charge of courses brought me in one day and asked which one I wanted to take and to choose one, but I asked if I could take both and I did. I learnt so much in those two subjects and knew that that was what I wanted to do. I wanted a career in IT. There was a person that really is the major reason that I chose to do IT as my career instead of just a hobby on the side. My teacher in year 8, year 11 and the informatics teacher in year 12, Mr Croft. He nominated me for the Western Chances scholarship for excellence in IT. This scholarship gave me $850 to get all the tech software and hardware I wanted within reason and I received the scholarship for 3 years. He knew that when he gave out a 6-week assignment, I would be done in week 1 and helping my peers in week two. He started to challenge me and give me additional tasks I had to do for my work. Instead of a two-table database, mine had to have 5, and instead of importing one excel spreadsheet of data, I had to import 2, etc. He would mark me more harshly than the other students and really made me work hard to get full marks and helped me refine my skills in IT. He is the reason I wanted to study IT at a tertiary institution.
               <br><br>  Test Results: <br><br>
                 Some of the results surprised me, I thought I was more of a visual learner, but it seems I am more of an auditory learner than I had first thought. The creativity test was surprising too, I thought I was creative but according to the test I am just above average. The Myers Briggs/personality test was interesting to look at as it showed me that even though I thought I was introverted I am clearly not and the questions asked showed me that I tend to find it easy to work with new people so that will definitely help with the next project. I knew I was not as observant as I was intuitive and the prospecting one was not surprising either. I am always thinking about what if, what would happen if that happened. What would happen if the monarch were reinstated in Australia against the people’s wishes and would be the consequences and the reactions of the public. I was often the person asked, ‘what are you thinking about?’ and I would come out with something so random that it would either make people laugh or look concerned.
                <br><br> Career plan: <br><br>
                 My career plan and ideal job has not changed, and the feedback and research done in both Assignment 1 and Assignment 2 has reaffirmed that game development is both a large industry and is on the rise. This position is like other program development positions but is specialised for creating games across various platforms. Entry level game programming positions for pc and mobile games only require a bachelor’s degree featuring programming languages and require experience in Unity and C based languages. A step up requires some experience on your belt and a portfolio with some well-reviewed games.

            <h1 id="subHeading">Renelo Zammit</h1>
                 <p>About me: <br><br>
                  I was born and raised in Melbourne, but however my ethnicity consists of 50% Maltese and 50% Filipino, as my parents from both countries migrated to Australia before I was born. I graduated from high school in Melbourne’s Western suburbs last year, while hoping that I would make it into the Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT. Some of my hobbies include exercising, hanging out with friends, playing video games, jamming out to music, mucking around with my kitten, and, of course technology! I used to be really into the whole world of video games, but then I realised that I became addicted to them too easily, so I decided to cut them out of my life – except for one… Counter Strike!! – (which I have way too many hours on it is embarrassing). I chose to study at RMIT because of many, many reasons. First being its good reputation for subjects in the arts, science, and technology industries, as from what I have heard from friends, family, news sources, and career advisors. Secondly would have to be my huge hobby/interest in IT and technology! I have absolutely loved technology since I was about 5 or 6 (from what I can remember) when my parents bought me a toy laptop. 
                  <br><br> Interest in IT: <br><br>
                  Well, as I briefly stated in my ‘ABOUT ME’ section, my interest in technology and IT started when I was around 5 or 6, when my parents got me a toy laptop for my birthday. I was hooked into the world of technology and IT ever since. When I was a kid, I just had a big interest with IT software and hardware – like for example, how they work, and how they’re made. My family got their first desktop PC when I was around 10 (I think), and I can definitely say that I was on that thing pretty much every day playing the pre-installed Windows XP games (solitaire, Space Pinball, minesweeper, etc.), as we had no internet connect at the time.  
                  Throughout my whole high school life, I knew that I wanted to peruse my future in the world/industry of IT. I would choose every IT-related subject elective in which was available at school over the science/maths/artsy type subjects as technology just fascinated me; but however, I never really knew which specific field of IT I wanted to go into was – whether it be software, hardware, security, engineering, etc, but I feel as if I know have some sort of idea; cybersecurity! 
                  Really only up until this year, 2020, was when I finally researched the different fields within the IT industry, and I can say that cybersecurity really stood out to me. There’s just something about helping the community be safe on the internet that brings a little joy to myself; especially, because nowadays crimes over computers and the internet is rising as more and more people are starting to use digital technology for personal and private things, such as transferring money, completing tax returns, shopping online, etc. I also believe that people need to be more educated about the risks of handing out their personal information via the web, as criminals can commit some very serious offenses when they obtain people’s personal info. 
                  I also believe that the IT industry one of the fastest growing industry’s at the moment, as people are becoming more and more dependent on the use of technology in their everyday lives, so I think it’s safe to say that the many fields within the IT industry will only ever be increasing in demand, not slowing and decreasing like other industry’s out there right now. 
                <br><br>  Test Result: <br><br>
                  These test results suggest that I am more of an extroverted person when it comes to people and environments (I scored 83% on the extrovert section of the tests). This means that scientifically, I am more suited to working in groups rather than by myself – which is very much certainly the case in my opinion too. In terms of how I am best suited to learn – I am more of a visual person than anything else. This means that I tend to learn better and retain more information when there are visual representations on the page, such as images or diagrams. 
                  I’ll make sure to compare my test results with my group members so that we are all on the same page, and that we can incorporate specific modifications and allowances in our work and work ethics so that we can all complete the assessment to the best of our abilities. 
                <br><br>  Career plan: <br><br>
                  If I were to see myself in an IT-related career in the next, say 4-5 years, I would ideally see myself working in the cybersecurity industry. My main reason as to which I prefer this industry is because I really think cybersecurity workers are a great help towards society, as they help maintain society safe and secure while on the internet and around IT devices. In comparison to my fellow team members, surprising, no one else seems to have considered the field of cybersecurity for their ideal job choice – as, they’re all leaning more towards the programming side of the table, like for example game design, or software development. Hopefully after collaborating with my peers, I’ll be able to see and understand the reasons as to why they have chosen those as their ideal careers and we’ll see if my ideal career plan is influenced by them!

            <h1 id="subHeading">Anthony Thomas </h1>
                 <p>About me: <br><br>
 
                  I started studying an Associate Degree in Mechanical Engineering at RMIT in 2012 after graduating high school. After two years of study I managed to confirm that I immensely dislike Mechanical Engineering. So, I decided to double down and start another Associate degree in Civil Engineering. After another two years of study I graduated with two Associate Degrees and had confirmed that Engineering may not be the sort of thing I enjoy. 
                 After graduating I lived abroad in Asia, Europe and most recently, North America, where I was working in the Canadian Rockies at a backcountry lodge, taking people on hiking tours in summer and cross-country skiing in winter. When the Covid-19 pandemic hit, I decided to return to Australia when the company I was working for was forced to close its doors and could no longer sponsor my visa. 
            <br><br>     Interest In IT: <br><br>

                 When I was living in Hanoi, working as an English teacher was where my interest in IT was first sparked. The community of expats in my area were a mix of different professionals, and a small group of them worked in IT; Programmers, Web developers, and other consultants who all had the ability to work remotely and travel to different parts of the world. Seeing the freedom their roles allowed them was very intriguing and I began to consider the possibility of a future in IT. 
                 When I had to relocate back to Melbourne this year, a friend suggested that I apply for an entry level job at their Telcom company, Aussie Broadband. Despite having very little knowledge and no experience in the industry I got a Customer service Sales position. Shortly after starting I was transitioned to working remotely in response to the growing COVID-19 restrictions. Working from home reminded me of the expats in Hanoi, some of who have continued living abroad throughout the pandemic and have managed to maintain stability in their jobs. 
                 Even though my experience of working remotely is from a desk in my flat and not Hanoi, it has me considering a career in IT and how I could expand my role within Aussie Broadband, or even shape a future career around the lifestyle I enjoy, that is challenging, interesting and secure. 
              <br><br>   Test Result: <br><br>
                 The results from all my tests suggest in relation to group work, my strengths are big picture thinking and brain storming ideas. When it comes to expanding on individual ideas or small details, I can become side-tracked, and it may be best to allocate more detailed tasks to another group member. The tests also suggest that I should be able to work competently within a group, but my personality type can frustrate other members when I lose track of what I am working on. My leadership style test suggested that I would be an autocratic leader, which is not conducive to group work. However, I do not feel that this accurate depiction of how I participate in team projects, but it is something that I will aim to be conscious of.
               <br><br>   Career plan: <br><br>
                 My career plan is much the same as it was at the start of subject, I am still interested in pursing a career in IT and working remotely. However, having been exposed to the many different facets of the industry I wouldn’t be surprised if I found another part of the industry that intrigues me. I will continue to work full time at my position at Aussie Broadband, but I suspect my original time frame to finish at degree was unrealistic especially having now worked full time and studied for the whole semester. I will probably study part time well working full time instead of trying to juggle both. Working remotely as a Full Stack developer is still my career goal but I will continue explore different option as a I progress through my degree.

                 <p>About me: <br> <br>
                  Hi, my name is Yi Da Dai, or you can call me Eric if my Chinese name is too confusing to read. I come from Shanghai, China which I am currently living due to Covid-19. Yet I have been studying in Australia since year 8. For me it was an extremely valuable and memorable experience.

                  My main interest: Generally, IT YES! :) and lots of smaller hobby that correspond to IT such as building computers, CNC machining Etc.

                  My other interest: I love playing basketball, playing games and listen to different varieties of music. I am currently really into some Rock Artists/Bands like Pink Floyd, King Crimson and David Bowie.
                <br><br>  Interest In IT: <br><br>
                  It all started from when I was in my Childhood, my dad used to guide me with his old chunky laptop and showed me cs1.6. At that time, I was blown away by such Magic and wondered how everything works. As time progress I have seen how technology innovates and how much of a bright future that IT can bring us.

                  My main interest in IT is about how data interact with each other and how we can manage them efficiently and functionally. I'm also interested in networking overall.
                 <br><br>  Career plan: <br> <br>
