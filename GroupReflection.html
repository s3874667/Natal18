          Overall, as a whole, I feel this assignment we worked better as a group. We had organized weekly meetings and nearly all of us attended regularly, we also split the meeting minutes up between us so that everyone had a go at writing it, this way it wasnâ€™t hard to compile all the information at the end. We also were able to split the GitHub and website development, so that one person did not have to do all the work like last assignment. However, we did have our shortcomings as a couple of our members were caught up with issues in their life could not attend and complete all work. However, this is understandable. However, we all did our part and helped each other out. I felt like our communication was also better overall in this assignment compared to others, however it wasnâ€™t perfect but that was expected. In conclusion, I really enjoyed working together as a group to complete this project.

          Specific days were allocated for meetings on which we were sure that everyone can attend so on almost all the meetings everyone came. The group decided that a new member will write the meeting minutes instead of just one member writing the minutes every time, so, this responsibility got divided. Anthony did a great job on dividing up the assignment tasks. However, even though the tasks were divided everyone could not finish everything within the allocated time we set to finish the tasks. Not everyone communicated in a well which was quite important as communication is a key while working in group works. Thus, that can be improved. One thing which came as a surprise to us was that we have to create a prototype but still, we found that out two weeks before the submission date which gave us enough time to think about it. In this assignment, as everyone tried and attended almost all the meetings, there was a proper communication between most of the group members which further helped to understand the required tasks that needed to be completed. Therefore, I enjoyed working with this team.

          What went well in the group was the cohesion and cooperation of all the members, something else that went well was the quality of the work being written by each member and the group as a whole. What could be improved would be a more balanced breakdown of tasks, other than that nothing else needed to be improved as a group. One thing that was surprising was the level of detail that the fridgeâ€™s operating system needed to be conceptualized. Something I have learned about groups is that it can be difficult balancing each otherâ€™s lives and schedules into a team. The group has gone well, and each member of the team contributed a lot towards the completion of the assignment and moving forward I feel confident in the completion of the presentation.

          I feel as if our team worked well in attending, being present, and taking â€˜meeting minutesâ€™ of our frequent group meetings and discussions. However, I feel as if certain members within our group could work on their communication. In example, checking the communication software â€“ in our case Microsoft Teams, which should be checked at least once a day. If I were to isolate something in which I found exciting, it would be the amount of work which could be done in a matter of days when working in a group. Of course, this sounds like common sense, but I never actually comprehended that like a group of six people (our case), could smash out making an entire website in only a couple of days. In terms of working in and with a group, I have learnt that some group members care slightly less about the overall outcome of the groupâ€™s work (not trying to point fingers here by the way ðŸ˜‰).

          In the A3, our team reflect on our previous teamwork and improved a lot among that. Each team member includes me did a fantastic job on organizing task, communicate to each other, respond to unpredictable changes and overall helping each other. Although there are still a lot of things that we still can improve. I appreciate my teammates that they can step up and help other teammates to fill their gap because of issues in life. I appreciate that I can work with these people that are easy to communicate and each one has different skill sets that can be applied in different parts of the project. Yet, I will improve on the time management of the website making, we should of make the website earlier as we make each part of the texts. Overall, Iâ€™m happy with my team and Iâ€™m really looking forward for future corporation.

          We changed the way we structured group meeting, so it took the load off somebody to chair it every time. We rotated this position so it wouldnâ€™t always be an individualâ€™s responsibility to organize everyone. This worked a lot better then last time and we where all able to be a little bit better organized then last time. We also tried to divide the tasks differently so the workload with be divided more evenly. Both strategies worked well at first but fell apart a little bit towards the end when we had to change the direction of the project a bit. We had productive group discussion throughout the project. We did have some group members who contributed significantly less than other, but they had work commitments and personal issues they had to attended to. Which ill happen from time to time but when you have a six week time frame for a project you would hope that they could plan around it in the future. Working with this group was still a positive experience.

          The group worked well a lot better than the last assignment and improved in many areas, including but not ranged to a better and clearer breakdown of the tasks to writing up a written report this time. Something that was made clear by the group was that the overall quality of work completed by each member of the group was to a high standard and improved substantially from the last assignment. Each member of the group contributed and attended various meetings across the timeframe of Assignment 3. <br>
          <br>
           Another area that was mentioned by several members was the website. Last assignment, Yi took up the mantle and completed the website on his own, including developing, coding, and formatting the entire GitHub page. This time, multiple members from the group broke down the website into sections and worked together to alleviate the amount of work that had to be done for the website. Another positive change mentioned was the breakdown of the Microsoft Teams work, each member chaired at least one meeting and wrote the minutes. This allowed each member of the group to share the work a lot better than the last assignment.
          <br><br>
           The breakdown of tasks was a double edged sword, while most of the group agreed that it was a substantial improvement compared to the last assignment and broke down the tasks clearly near the beginning of the assignment, some believed that it could be improved further and needs a little work to make it the best it could be. The breakdown of tasks could be improved but, it delegated the tasks a lot better and clearer to each member of the group. There was a large surprise in store for the team when we consulted with Anthony. When asked about the development of a prototype of sorts we were struck dumb, like a deer in headlights. That was something we never accounted for and threw our breakdown of tasks into chaos. An improvement of sorts could be having a meeting to scrutinize the specifications of the assignment and break it down into itâ€™s simplest form to ensure that we have met all requirements and have fully completed each section of the assignment. The team agrees that there has been a large improvement from the last assignment, but we could still improve as a group further.
