        <h3 id="subHeading"> Topic </h3>
        <p>
          The main purpose of this project is to introduce a new smart fridge to the market. “The Natal Fridge” will help reduce the amount of food wasted within households by implementing a series of new systems and services that current smart fridges on the market do not possess.  At initial release, the fridge will have several unique features, setting it apart from other smart fridges and aiming to have a significant impact on reducing food waste. After initial release, the Natal fridge will go through different iterations, refining the systems introducing new features and services.<br><br>

          The Natal fridge will come in different capacities to cater for different sized households. The fridge itself is aesthetically similar to other smart fridges. One of the doors will house a large touch screen that acts as the main user interface and will also have a companion app enabling users to interact with the fridge from a smart phone.<br><br>

          The Natal fridge has custom software and a smart AI assistant named Tummy, which is its main point of difference from market competition. The user will initially create a household profile that contains information about each household member: Height, weight, age, dietary preferences etc. From these profiles, Tummy will create custom meals, diet plans and shopping lists that can be refined and adapted over time, dependent on household needs and preferences. Tummy will also monitor food stocked in fridge, ensuring minimal waste due to spoilage. When constructing shopping lists, Tummy will order food in precise quantities for the meal plans it generates.

        <h3 id="subHeading"> Motivation </h3>
        <p>
          There are three main motivations for this project, this project explores home automation and Ai technology.<br> The main motivations for this project are environmental and has been refined to three main motivations.

        <h3>  Reducing food waste and environmental impact of food production </h3>
              Globally, a third of all fresh produce, such as fruits, dairy and meat, is lost to waste; costing the global economy approximately 990 billion dollars a year (Food and Agriculture organization of the United Nations, 2020). In Australia, 34% of total food waste is from households (ARCADIS, 2019), with the most common cause being produce spoiling when left too long in a fridge or freezer, followed by people not finishing meals (Surprising Facts about Food Waste, 2020).
              <br><br>
              Current estimates state that 26% of all global greenhouse gas emissions are generated from food production (Ritchie and Roser, 2020), and 70% of global freshwater usage is for agriculture. (Ritchie and Roser, 2020). If the introduction of the Natal fridge was able to reduce average household food waste by just 50%, it would in turn reduce total greenhouse gas emissions from food production by approximately 2%, saving the global economy billions of dollars every year.
        <h3>  Help users manage their caloric intake </h3>
              Currently, 67% of Australian adults are considered overweight or obese. (Department of Health | Overweight and Obesity, 2020). One aim of the smart fridge AI is help users more effectively manage their daily intake of calories, and therefore reduce nationwide obesity rates.

        <h3>  Reduce time spent shopping</h3>
              The average person will go grocery shopping 1.6 times a week, spending approximately 43 minutes per trip. Annually, that equates to around 56 hours. (Save time by becoming a smarter grocery shopper - ABC Life, 2020) If an individual shops once a week between the ages of 18 and 75, this equates to 3100 hours (129 days) over their lifetime; an immense amount of time to be dedicated to a single task.
        </p>


        <h3 id="subHeading"> Landscape </h3>
        <p>
        <h3> Competitors </h3>
        Currently there are no smart fridges on the market that have an AI assistant, or any of the other new systems the Natal fridge will have on release. The main competitor at present is the Samsung Family Hub (Family Hub™ Refrigerators | Samsung Australia, 2020), which currently retails between $4,999.00 and $5,999.00 (Samsung SRF825BFH4 825L Family Hub Refrigerator at The Good Guys, 2020), with cost varying according to capacity.
        <br><br>
        The principle of the family hub as a product revolves around it being the centre of a family home. The touch display on the front allows household members to leave notes for each other, or post images from their smart phones, similar to placing physical photos on a standard fridge with magnets The touch display on the Samsung Family Hub functions similarly to an android tablet, and has the ability to answer calls, watch YouTube videos, etc.  The Family Hub can also be integrated to into Samsung’s other SmartThings systems.  It is equipped with an internal camera, allowing users see what is currently in their fridge, or view what was in there at a previous date.
        <br><br>
        In terms of physical aesthetics and design, The Natal Fridge will not differ greatly from The Samsung Family Hub or other smart fridges on the market. The main interface will be a high definition display on the exterior of the fridge door and possess similar functionality of Family Hub as described above.
        <br><br>
        <h3> Features </h3>
          The Natal Fridge has three main features that will make in unique vs other smart fridges on the market.<br> All of which will be monitored by Tummy AI assistant that will have access to large data base of information.<br> These features are:
          <h3> Household Profile and Diet Customization </h3>
               This feature allows users to create a household profile, inputting personal information for each member into the fridges database. Tummy would then create a series of suitable meal plans for each individual user, which can be adapted over time dependant on the needs to each household member. As Tummy learnt the food preferences for each user, it would suggest new recipes based on those preferences.

          <h3> Smart Food Ordering and Replenishing Staples </h3>
              After Tummy has a created a household meal plan that considers each individual needs, it would compile a shopping list of raw ingredients required, in specific portions. After the shopping list has been approved by a user, the order will be instantly placed with their preferred supermarket chain.
              <br><br>
              Over time, Tummy would track the eating habits of each user and automatically add household staples to the shopping list that are not part of the constructed meal plans. For example, if a household member drinks approximately four litres of soda water each week, the fridge will take note and add soda water to the regular grocery list.

         <h3> Food spoilage alerts and notifications.</h3>
              Tummy will actively monitor The Natal Fridge’s contents, sending notifications to both the front display and companion app to inform the user when items are close to expiry dates. For example, if an item such as yoghurt was about to expire, Tummy will notify users, but also suggest having smoothies for breakfast the following day. This would ideally prevent items spoiling and going to waste. In the case of leftovers, Tummy would also send a household reminder for users to consume foods before a certain date.
